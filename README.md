# 📱 Mobile Price Classification

A robust Machine Learning project that predicts the price range of mobile phones based on key hardware and software specifications. This solution aims to bridge the gap between raw tech specs and informed consumer decision-making by enabling accurate price category predictions.

##  Overview

With the exponential growth in smartphone usage and variety, classifying mobile phones into price categories has become a complex challenge. This project leverages the power of **supervised machine learning algorithms** to accurately categorize mobile devices into four price ranges: **Low**, **Medium**, **High**, and **Premium**.

Whether you're a data scientist exploring model performance or a tech-savvy consumer seeking clarity, this project offers a clear, data-driven approach to understanding mobile price segmentation.
